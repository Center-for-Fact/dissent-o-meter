Timeline Clustering with K-Medoids

This repository contains two scripts that combine distance matrix clustering (K-Medoids) with historical timeline density visualization (KDE plots). The scripts help analyze how clusters of languages (from Wikipedia-derived corpora) align in time.

Script 1: Timeline Plots (1800–2025)

Purpose

Clusters languages using K-Medoids on precomputed Wasserstein distance matrices.

Extracts date mentions (only between 1800–2025).

Removes global outliers (furthest 10% from temporal cluster medians).

Plots KDE timelines of clusters in:

Absolute time (x-axis = actual years).

Relative time (x-axis = years relative to each medoid’s center).

Output

PNG plots stored in ~/Desktop/timeline_plots_1800_2025/

Script 2: Timeline Plots (−500–2025)

File: timeline_kmedoids_full.py

Purpose

Same as Script 1, but:

Accepts wider historical span (−500 to 2025).

Useful for BCE/early historical timelines.

Key Features (Both Scripts)

Clustering

Uses KMedoids (sklearn_extra.cluster).

Input: Wasserstein distance matrix.

Number of clusters = configurable (n_clusters=6).

Outlier Removal

For each cluster, compute median year.

Calculate deviation of each language’s median year from cluster median.

Remove top 10% outliers (outlier_frac=0.1).

Visualization

Absolute plots: KDE of mentions aligned on timeline (1800–2025 or −500–2025).

Relative plots: KDE of mentions aligned to cluster medoid’s center (centered at 0).
