Arad, (also Er or Nita) is the cuneiform sign for "servant" in Sumerian and is equivalent to the Akkadian word "wardu", meaning servant. The word is specifically used in the introduction of a letter to a pharaoh: for example, "To the king, my lord - (my god, my Sun-god, my lord) - as to the dirt under your feet". It is also widely used in the Amarna letters, by the author, usually the "mayor" of a city-state, where there is a constant reminder that he is a "servant", or "your servant" - (of the pharaoh). Many of the letters give reports on the state of the city-state, but many also request the assistance of Egyptian troops - (Egyptian archers, the maryannu), which the pharaoh has provided them. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, the cuneiform sign for Arad, Er, and Nita is used several times in the Amarna letters, but specifically from the city-states of Canaan - (Ki-na-á¸«i-(-ha-) with cuneiform).
