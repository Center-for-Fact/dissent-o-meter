Mentions & Word Counts Visualization Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts that generate visualizations from Wikipedia-based multilingual historical corpora. Both scripts read pre-processed CSV files (containing language filenames, extracted dates, or word counts) and output category-based visual summaries.

Script 1: Mentions across Time Windows


Purpose

Generates side-by-side bar charts showing:

Height = total mentions of years inside each time window.

Width = number of languages contributing mentions.

Key Features

Five historical time windows are defined in TIME_WINDOWS such as

1917–1920

1939–1945

1789–1799

Annotates each bar with:

Languages contributing (langs)

Total mentions (mentions)

Side-by-side comparison across sports, ideologies, and objects.



Script 2: Word Counts per Language


Purpose

Generates horizontal bar charts of word counts (log-transformed) for each language in every category.

Key Features

Log10 transformation applied to word counts.

Separate figure per category (sports, ideologies, objects).

Languages sorted by word count for clarity.

Dynamic figure height: scales with the number of languages (0.25 inch per language).
